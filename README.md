## Guten tag 👋
I'm Ali, interested in graphic design and Python. I can almost say I'm a computer engineer, and I'm deeply passionate about reading books.

"I really enjoy reading books about practical computer algorithms in everyday human life, and I’m also interested in ancient philosophy—precisely where computers and daily human life intersect."
## Fun 🤗
"When I get nervous, I like to cook. I put love into the food — cooking is an art. 
 also interested in playing billiards."🎱👨‍🍳

 ## Life
 "I will never marry, and I will choose loneliness."🚶‍♂️👌
